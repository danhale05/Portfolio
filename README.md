Portfolio

Originally built on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/TheDan05/pen/vyrLKK) from a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) challenge, using Bootstrap and some of my drawings for examples.

To use, you would simply open the index.html page in the root folder. I've included my pictures/artwork so it would be a complete page, at least without any broken images.
